# Known Bugs

Tracked issues to fix in future sessions.

---

## Input

- [ ] **Space counts as missed letter** - Pressing space triggers a wrong input. Should ignore all non-alphanumeric keys.

---

## Visual / Layout

- [ ] **Letters spawn at top row only** - Letters should scatter throughout the game board, not just the top.
- [ ] **Blank display overflow** - Long phrases overflow off screen, can't see all letter slots.
- [ ] **Letters not appearing in blanks** - When correct letter typed, it doesn't visually appear in the blank slot.

---

## UI

- [ ] **Crusher state not shown** - UI still shows DORMANT but doesn't display STIRRING/LOOSENING states.

---

## Audio (Not Implemented)

- [ ] **Combo audio escalation** - "dun duN DUN POP" sound escalation on correct letter streaks.
